## Overview

In general retirement plans allow employers to send some of your compensation directly to a retirement account before you pay taxes on it, instead of depositing it in your usual personal checking account. This means that money that would normally go towards taxes can instead sit in a retirement account making money. If you have a retirement account available to you, it is usually a very good idea to take advantage of it. Generally speaking, you will have more money when you retire.

Many for-profit organizations have 401(k) plans for this purpose. Non-profits like ours can have something similar called a 403(b) plan, but both of those plan types require that employers pay big fees to the bank that provides the service. They are also very difficult to administer. They're for bigger companies than ours. For organizations like ours, there's something called a [SIMPLE IRA Plan][simple], that is actually quite simple and works similarly, with the main downside being that it has a lower per-year maximum contribution rate.

 
## Eligibility

All full time employees are eligible to receive this benefit and are encouraged to take advantage of it.


## Benefit

Eligible employees may make salary reduction contributions to the plan.

Free Law Project will match your contributions up to the legal limit of 3% of your compensation.

Contributions may be changed on no more than a monthly basis.

In 2021, the maximum an individual can contribute is $13,500 unless over the age of 50 (in which case other details apply).
